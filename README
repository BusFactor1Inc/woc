woc - word occurance
--------------------

This program is designed to count the number of occurances of a set of
words in a set of files and produce a score listing.  

It's a poor man's Google for the filesystem.

usage: woc [words...] <-- [files or directories...]>

Putting a '-' in front of a word will invert it's count value in the
results.

If a directory is specified after --, all of the files in that
directory will be scanned.  If no files or directories re specified,
the current directory is used.

Exapmle:

    $ woc woc # count all occurances of the word 'woc' in the files at
              #  and below the current directory
